# RPI Loop CLI Tool - MVP Implementation Tasks
*Simplified implementation plan focused on core value delivery*

## Implementation Strategy

**Focus**: Build the simplest tool that delivers immediate value through Claude Code prompt generation
**Timeline**: 3 weeks to MVP launch
**Task Count**: 32 atomic tasks (reduced from 158)
**Success Metric**: 10 developers complete full RPI cycle in <15 minutes

## Phase 1: Core CLI Foundation (Week 1)
*Target: Working CLI that generates prompts*

### Project Setup (5 tasks)
- [ ] Create `rpi-loop` directory and run `npm init -y`
- [ ] Install core dependencies: `commander`, `fs-extra`, `handlebars`, `chalk`
- [ ] Create basic directory structure: `bin/`, `lib/`, `templates/`
- [ ] Set up `bin/rpi.js` with shebang and Commander.js basics
- [ ] Test CLI loads with `node bin/rpi.js --help`

### Core Commands (8 tasks)
- [ ] Implement `rpi init <topic>` command with basic file creation
- [ ] Create simple `./rpi/` directory structure (no complex sessions)
- [ ] Implement `rpi research` command that generates research template + prompt
- [ ] Implement `rpi plan` command that loads research and generates planning prompt
- [ ] Implement `rpi implement` command that loads plan and generates implementation prompt
- [ ] Add `rpi status` command showing current phase and next steps
- [ ] Add `--help` text for all commands with clear examples
- [ ] Test complete workflow: `init → research → plan → implement`

### File Management (7 tasks)
- [ ] Create simple file manager class for read/write operations
- [ ] Implement template rendering with basic Handlebars (no customization)
- [ ] Create research template (simplified - no validation complexity)
- [ ] Create planning template (simplified - focuses on atomic tasks)
- [ ] Create implementation template (simplified - basic progress tracking)
- [ ] Generate Claude Code prompts with proper context handoff
- [ ] Test file operations handle edge cases (permissions, missing dirs)

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All commands work and generate appropriate files
- [ ] Complete workflow executes without errors
- [ ] Templates render with dynamic content (topic, timestamp)
- [ ] Prompts include relevant context from previous phases

---

## Phase 2: Claude Code Integration Excellence (Week 1)
*Target: Seamless Claude Code workflow*

### Prompt Generation (6 tasks)
- [ ] Perfect research prompt with clear instructions and template
- [ ] Perfect planning prompt that includes research context intelligently
- [ ] Perfect implementation prompt that includes plan context
- [ ] Test prompts in actual Claude Code sessions for effectiveness
- [ ] Add context size warnings in prompts (basic, not monitoring)
- [ ] Validate prompt quality with 3 different real projects

### User Experience (4 tasks)
- [ ] Add colored terminal output with chalk for better UX
- [ ] Add progress indicators and clear next-step guidance
- [ ] Add error handling with helpful messages (not generic errors)
- [ ] Test entire workflow with fresh eyes (simulate new user)

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Prompts produce high-quality Claude Code responses
- [ ] User experience is intuitive without documentation
- [ ] Error messages guide users to solutions
- [ ] Visual feedback makes progress clear

---

## Phase 3: Polish & Distribution (Week 1)
*Target: Production-ready package*

### Testing & Quality (3 tasks)
- [ ] Create basic end-to-end test for complete RPI workflow
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Add basic error handling for common failure modes

### Documentation & Distribution (5 tasks)
- [ ] Create simple README with installation and 5-minute example
- [ ] Update package.json for npm publishing (keywords, description)
- [ ] Create `.npmignore` and test `npm pack`
- [ ] Publish to npm as beta version for testing
- [ ] Test installation on clean system: `npm install -g rpi-loop`

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Package installs globally without issues
- [ ] README enables successful first use
- [ ] Works on all major platforms
- [ ] Beta testers can complete workflow successfully

## What We're NOT Building (Moved to V2)

### Features Explicitly Excluded from MVP:
- ❌ Context monitoring and 40% utilization tracking
- ❌ Complex session management with state persistence
- ❌ Template customization and user overrides
- ❌ Multiple example workflows and tutorials
- ❌ Advanced error recovery and rollback
- ❌ Performance benchmarking and optimization
- ❌ Comprehensive test coverage (95%+ target)
- ❌ Team collaboration features
- ❌ Enterprise configuration options
- ❌ Analytics and usage tracking

### Why These Exclusions Make Sense:
1. **Complexity kills adoption** - Simple tools spread faster
2. **Prove core value first** - Better prompts must demonstrate value
3. **Iterate based on usage** - Real feedback > imagined features
4. **Reduce failure risk** - Less code = fewer bugs
5. **Faster time to market** - 3 weeks vs 8+ weeks

## Success Metrics

### MVP Launch Success Criteria:
- [ ] 100+ GitHub stars in first month
- [ ] 10+ developers complete full RPI cycle
- [ ] 5+ positive testimonials/tweets
- [ ] 0 critical bugs reported
- [ ] <2 minute installation on clean system
- [ ] <10 minute first complete cycle

### What Success Looks Like:
```bash
# Developer installs tool
npm install -g rpi-loop

# Developer uses tool
cd my-project
rpi init "add user authentication"
# Copy prompt to Claude Code
# Paste response back
rpi plan
# Copy prompt to Claude Code
# Paste response back
rpi implement
# Start building with clear plan

# Developer reaction: "This actually helped!"
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk: Tool Quality
**Mitigation**: Focus on flawless core experience over feature completeness

### Secondary Risk: Adoption Friction  
**Mitigation**: 2-minute setup goal, zero configuration required

### Tertiary Risk: Value Clarity
**Mitigation**: Clear examples showing better Claude Code outputs

## Final Notes

This MVP plan represents an **80% reduction in complexity** while maintaining **100% of core value proposition**. The focus is entirely on:

1. **Installation simplicity** - Works immediately
2. **Workflow clarity** - Obvious next steps
3. **Prompt quality** - Better Claude Code outputs
4. **User success** - Developers achieve their goals

By removing 126 tasks of complexity, we can:
- Ship 5 weeks faster
- Reduce bug surface area by 80%
- Get real user feedback sooner
- Iterate based on actual usage

**The goal**: Make RPI Loop the obvious choice for anyone using Claude Code for development.
