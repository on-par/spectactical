## RESEARCH PHASE: {{topic}}

I need you to research "{{topic}}" following the RPI methodology.

**IMPORTANT**: Focus only on the What and Why at a high level. Don't get into implementation details.

Your research should make you an expert on this topic and capture:

### 1. Problem Statement
- **What are we solving?** - The core problem or feature need
- **Why does this matter?** - Business impact and importance  
- **What's the current pain?** - Existing problems and limitations

### 2. System Understanding
- **How does the current system work?** - Architecture overview
- **Key files**: `path/file.ext:line-range` - Specific file locations and purposes
- **Data flow**: Component A ‚Üí Component B ‚Üí Component C
- **Critical dependencies**: External services, databases, APIs

### 3. Problem Location
- **Where is the issue/feature located?** - Primary files and components
- **What are the integration points?** - How this connects to other parts
- **What are the related components?** - Upstream/downstream effects

### 4. Constraints & Requirements
- **Technical constraints**: Performance, compatibility, security, scale
- **Business constraints**: Timeline, resources, compliance
- **Team constraints**: Skills, availability, process limitations

### 5. Success Criteria
- **Functional requirements**: What functionality must be delivered
- **Performance requirements**: Speed, throughput, resource usage targets
- **Quality requirements**: Testing, security, maintainability standards

### 6. Open Questions
- **Technical questions**: Architecture, approach, integration uncertainties
- **Business questions**: Requirements, priorities, user experience decisions
- **Process questions**: Deployment, testing, review procedures

## Research Guidelines:

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Use grep/search tools to understand the codebase
- ‚úÖ Read existing files to understand current architecture
- ‚úÖ Include specific file paths with line numbers (file.ext:123-145)
- ‚úÖ Focus on business context and user impact
- ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions about unclear requirements
- ‚úÖ Identify all constraints and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Define measurable success criteria

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Write any implementation code
- ‚ùå Design specific technical solutions
- ‚ùå Get into implementation details
- ‚ùå Make technology choices or architectural decisions
- ‚ùå Write pseudo-code or algorithms

### Context Management:
- Monitor your context utilization - aim to stay under 40%
- Use subagents for complex searches if available
- Focus on understanding, not problem-solving
- Keep responses structured and scannable

**Remember**: Research phase is about understanding the problem space completely. Save the "how" for the planning phase. Focus on the "what" and "why" now.

**Next Steps**: After completing research, save to `01-research.md` and run `/rpi research validate` to check completeness before moving to planning phase.
