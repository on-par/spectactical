# RPI Loop MVP Success Criteria
*Clear, measurable criteria for MVP validation*

## Primary Success Metric

**Can 10 developers install and complete their first RPI cycle in under 15 minutes?**

If YES → Add features  
If NO → Fix core experience first

---

## Pre-Launch Validation (Week 3)

### Installation Success
- [ ] `npm install -g rpi-loop` works on Mac, Linux, Windows
- [ ] Installation completes in <30 seconds on standard connection
- [ ] No dependency conflicts or warnings
- [ ] `rpi --help` displays immediately after install

### First-Use Success
- [ ] Developer can start first RPI cycle within 2 minutes of installation
- [ ] No configuration files needed
- [ ] No documentation required for basic usage
- [ ] Clear error messages if something goes wrong

### Workflow Completion
- [ ] Complete cycle (init → research → plan → implement) in <10 minutes
- [ ] Each generated prompt works in Claude Code without modification
- [ ] Claude Code responses are noticeably better with RPI prompts
- [ ] Developer understands next steps at each phase

---

## Launch Week Success (Week 4)

### Adoption Metrics
- [ ] 50+ GitHub stars in first week
- [ ] 100+ npm downloads
- [ ] 10+ developers complete full workflow
- [ ] 5+ unsolicited positive mentions (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] 0 critical bugs that block workflow
- [ ] <5 minor bugs reported
- [ ] All reported issues addressed within 48 hours
- [ ] No installation failures reported

### Engagement Metrics
- [ ] 3+ developers contribute improvements or report issues
- [ ] 2+ blog posts or tutorials created by community
- [ ] Active discussion in at least one developer community
- [ ] Positive sentiment in feedback (>80% positive)

---

## 30-Day Success Metrics

### Growth Indicators
- [ ] 200+ GitHub stars
- [ ] 500+ npm downloads
- [ ] 50+ developers have tried the tool
- [ ] 20+ developers use it regularly (multiple cycles)

### Value Validation
- [ ] 10+ testimonials about improved development workflow
- [ ] 5+ examples of complex features built with RPI
- [ ] Measurable improvement in Claude Code output quality
- [ ] Developers report fewer implementation surprises

### Community Health
- [ ] 10+ GitHub issues/discussions (shows engagement)
- [ ] 5+ community contributions (PRs, templates, examples)
- [ ] Active maintainer response time <24 hours
- [ ] Clear roadmap based on user feedback

---

## Critical Failure Indicators

**Stop and reassess if ANY of these occur:**

### Red Flags
- [ ] Installation fails for >10% of users
- [ ] >50% of users abandon before completing first cycle
- [ ] Generated prompts don't improve Claude Code outputs
- [ ] Workflow feels like "process overhead" not productivity tool
- [ ] Negative sentiment in developer communities
- [ ] Critical bugs that corrupt user projects

### Recovery Actions
1. **Installation failures** → Simplify dependencies, better testing
2. **High abandonment** → Simplify workflow, better onboarding
3. **Poor prompt quality** → Revise templates based on actual usage
4. **Process overhead feeling** → Reduce steps, increase automation
5. **Negative sentiment** → Listen, acknowledge, fix quickly
6. **Critical bugs** → Immediate patch, proactive communication

---

## User Feedback Validation

### Expected Positive Signals
- "This actually helps me think through problems"
- "Claude Code gives much better responses with these prompts"
- "I wish I had this for my last project"
- "The research phase caught issues I would have missed"
- "Planning phase made implementation straightforward"

### Warning Signals to Address
- "Too many steps for simple features"
- "Templates feel restrictive"
- "Not sure when to use this vs. just coding"
- "Prompts are too long for Claude Code"
- "Lost my work when command failed"

---

## MVP Feature Validation

### Core Features That Must Work
- [ ] `rpi init <topic>` creates correct structure every time
- [ ] `rpi research` generates useful research template
- [ ] `rpi plan` includes research context properly
- [ ] `rpi implement` includes plan context properly
- [ ] `rpi status` shows current phase clearly
- [ ] Prompts fit within Claude Code limits
- [ ] Context handoff between phases works smoothly

### Nice-to-Have Features (Can Be Imperfect)
- [ ] Colored terminal output (can be basic)
- [ ] Progress indicators (can be simple)
- [ ] Error recovery (can require manual intervention)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (can prioritize Mac/Linux)

---

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### GO - Proceed to V1.1 if:
- ✅ 10+ developers successfully complete RPI cycles
- ✅ Generated prompts demonstrably improve Claude Code outputs
- ✅ Installation and setup work reliably
- ✅ Positive community sentiment
- ✅ Clear value proposition validated

### NO-GO - Iterate on MVP if:
- ❌ <5 developers complete successful cycles
- ❌ Prompts don't improve Claude Code outputs
- ❌ Installation has >10% failure rate
- ❌ Negative or confused community reaction
- ❌ Value proposition unclear to users

---

## Success Story Template

**What we're looking for:**

"I used RPI Loop to [build specific feature]. The research phase helped me [understand specific complexity]. The planning phase broke it into [number] atomic tasks. Implementation took [time] with [zero/few] surprises. The Claude Code prompts were [specific improvement]. I would [definitely/probably] use this again."

**Target: 5+ organic success stories in first 30 days**

---

## MVP Validation Timeline

### Week 1: Build Core
- Focus on flawless basic workflow
- Test with personal projects

### Week 2: Private Beta
- 5-10 developer friends test
- Rapid iteration on feedback
- Fix all critical issues

### Week 3: Polish
- Refine based on beta feedback
- Ensure installation is bulletproof
- Create compelling examples

### Week 4: Public Launch
- Share on HackerNews, Reddit, Twitter
- Monitor feedback actively
- Iterate quickly on issues

### Day 30: Assess
- Review all success criteria
- Make go/no-go decision
- Plan V1.1 or MVP iteration

---

## The One Metric That Matters

**Would you recommend RPI Loop to another developer?**

Target: >70% "Yes" from users who complete at least one full cycle

This single question validates:
- Tool quality and reliability
- Value delivery on promise
- User experience satisfaction
- Future growth potential

---

## Final Note

MVP success is NOT about feature completeness or code quality perfection. It's about validating that:

1. **The tool can be installed and used easily**
2. **The methodology improves development outcomes**
3. **Developers see enough value to continue using it**
4. **The community wants this to exist and improve**

Everything else can be fixed, improved, and added later.
