✅ **Community building plan** with educational content series  
✅ **Industry influence pathway** mapped for 2-year horizon

## Key Strategic Insights Discovered

### Market Complexity Reality
- **7 distinct market segments** each requiring different value propositions
- **Sequential adoption required** - cannot serve all segments simultaneously
- **Cultural sensitivity critical** - methodology must enhance, not replace engineering autonomy
- **Evidence-based adoption** - all segments require proof, not promises

### Open Source Advantage Recognition
- **Eliminates adoption barriers** - no cost or procurement friction
- **Builds authentic credibility** - open source = genuine expertise in developer community
- **Enables viral growth** - community-driven adoption and improvement
- **Creates thought leadership platform** - foundation for industry influence

### Implementation Success Dependencies
- **Exceptional tool quality** - non-negotiable for any adoption success
- **Mid-level engineers + Teams** - optimal initial target for foundation building
- **Context management excellence** - 40% utilization rule enables better AI collaboration
- **Community-driven improvement** - users become methodology contributors and advocates
