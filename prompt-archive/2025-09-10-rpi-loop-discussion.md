Given the research we have in the @research/ folder, let's discuss a process I'm calling the "RPI Loop", where we research the What and Why (high level) without getting into the weeds of the problem, and loop over and refine that until we get to a point where we have any clarification questions answered to the point that an Agent is an expert on the topic and the problem is expertly defined at a high level. The plan step is where we take the research and high level design and break it down into atomic tasks - defined as a TODO list (`- [ ] task description`) such that each task could be completed by a single command (CLI, create file, edit file, tool use, etc) - and loop over the plan until the entirety of the research is entirely planned out such that once the entire TODO list is checked off, the feature or application would be deliverable. Once the plan loop is complete and verified (by AI and humans), the Implement loop begins - and this is the part that basically would be running a command line version of Claude Code with a prompt input (i.e. a slash command or something) to loop through until the tasks are all complete and everything is checked off. At each stage of the RPI loop, there must be validation (AI and/or human) done on the output. i.e. Research > verify > update research > research some more > verify > update research if any needed > repeat until no need to update, then ready for planning. Each loop should run in a fresh context (i.e. Research should run and output a markdown file, then verification should run in a fresh context to validate the research and update the output, etc.)

THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO MAKE A LIGHT WEIGHT SYSTEM THAT CAN EASILY BE APPLIED TO A CLAUDE CODE SESSION WITH LITTLE TO NO FRICTION AND BE EASY TO RUN AND FOLLOW THROUGH

the output from our discussion and/or solution to what we're trying to solve should be put into markdown files in a folder called ideation/ in the root. Let's discuss!
