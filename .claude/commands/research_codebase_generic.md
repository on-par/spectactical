# Research Codebase (Generic)

This command provides a comprehensive methodology for conducting thorough research across any codebase using parallel sub-agents and systematic investigation techniques.

## Process Overview

1. **Initial Analysis**: Understand research requirements and define scope
2. **Research Planning**: Break down investigation into focused areas
3. **Parallel Investigation**: Use specialized agents for different aspects
4. **Synthesis**: Combine findings into coherent architectural understanding
5. **Documentation**: Create structured, self-contained research documents
6. **Validation**: Verify findings and add permanent references

## Key Principles

### Systematic Investigation
- Use parallel Task agents for comprehensive coverage
- Read mentioned files fully before spawning sub-tasks
- Create focused, specific research objectives
- Synthesize findings from multiple perspectives

### Detailed Documentation
- Focus on concrete file paths and implementation details
- Explore cross-component connections and dependencies
- Maintain consistent documentation format
- Preserve directory structure and context

### Architectural Understanding
- Document how systems work together
- Identify key design patterns and decisions
- Map data flow and processing pipelines
- Highlight integration points and interfaces

## Research Methodology

### Stage 1: Scope Definition
- Understand the research question or objective
- Identify key areas requiring investigation
- Plan research strategy and sub-task allocation

### Stage 2: Parallel Investigation
- Spawn multiple Task agents with specific research goals
- Use appropriate analysis tools through specialized agents
- Focus each investigation on distinct aspects
- Coordinate findings across research areas

### Stage 3: Analysis and Synthesis
- Combine findings from all research tasks
- Identify patterns, connections, and relationships
- Document architectural insights and decisions
- Highlight important technical considerations

### Stage 4: Documentation and Validation
- Create comprehensive research document
- Include specific references and code examples
- Add permanent links for long-term reference
- Validate findings against actual implementation
