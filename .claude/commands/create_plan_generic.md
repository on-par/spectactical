# Create Generic Implementation Plan

This command creates a detailed implementation plan using an iterative, collaborative approach. The plan will be comprehensive, actionable, and based on thorough research.

## Process Overview

1. **Context Gathering & Initial Analysis**
2. **Research & Discovery**
3. **Plan Structure Development** 
4. **Detailed Plan Writing**
5. **Sync and Review**

## Key Principles

- **Be skeptical and thorough** - don't accept things at face value
- **Work collaboratively** - involve the user in the planning process
- **Read all context completely** - don't skim documentation or requirements
- **Spawn parallel research** - use multiple specialized agents simultaneously
- **Create detailed, actionable plans** - be specific about implementation steps
- **Include clear success criteria** - both automated and manual verification

## Implementation Methodology

### Stage 1: Context Gathering
- Read and understand the full context (requirements, specifications, etc.)
- Identify key stakeholders and success criteria
- Understand current system state and constraints

### Stage 2: Research & Discovery
- Spawn parallel research tasks using specialized agents
- Investigate technical requirements and dependencies
- Research existing implementations and patterns
- Identify potential risks and challenges

### Stage 3: Plan Structure Development
- Create high-level implementation phases
- Define success criteria and verification steps
- Identify automated vs manual verification requirements
- Plan testing and validation approach

### Stage 4: Detailed Plan Writing
- Write comprehensive implementation steps
- Include specific changes and modifications needed
- Document configuration and setup requirements
- Plan for edge cases and error handling

### Stage 5: Sync and Review
- Present plan to user for feedback
- Iterate based on user input
- Refine and finalize implementation approach

## Plan Template Structure

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Title]

## Overview
Brief description of what needs to be implemented

## Current State Analysis
What exists today and what needs to change

## Desired End State
Clear description of the target outcome

## Implementation Approach
High-level strategy and methodology

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- Specific steps
- Components to create/modify
- Success criteria

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- Next set of steps
- Dependencies on previous phases
- Validation approach

## Testing Strategy
- Tests to write/modify
- Manual verification steps
- Integration testing approach

## Considerations
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Maintainability factors

## Success Criteria

### Automated Verification
- Tests that must pass
- Performance benchmarks
- Quality metrics

### Manual Verification
- Feature functionality checks
- User experience validation
- Edge case verification

## Open Questions
- Items requiring further research
- Decisions pending user input
- Risks to investigate further
```

## Guidelines for Research Tasks

- Use specialized agents for complex investigations
- Spawn multiple tasks in parallel for efficiency
- Be specific about what each sub-task should investigate
- Coordinate findings from multiple sub-tasks into cohesive plan

## Success Criteria Guidelines

### Automated Verification
- Should be checkable by running commands or tools
- Include specific verification steps
- Define expected outputs/results

### Manual Verification
- Should be actionable steps a human can follow
- Include specific interactions to test
- Define expected outcomes and behaviors

## Implementation Considerations

### New Development
- Architecture and design patterns
- Integration requirements
- Documentation needs

### Modifications
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Testing strategy for changed behavior
- Impact on existing functionality

### Infrastructure
- Deployment requirements
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and observability

## Collaboration Approach

- Present initial findings and ask for user input
- Iterate on plan structure based on feedback
- Confirm implementation approach before finalizing
- Track open questions and resolve through discussion

The goal is to produce a comprehensive, well-researched implementation plan that addresses the specific requirements while being practical and executable.
