- **Phase 3**: Deep dive into authoritative sources
- **Phase 4**: Cross-reference and fact-checking across sources

### 2. Search Query Optimization
- Start with broad terms, then narrow down
- Use technical terminology when appropriate
- Include temporal qualifiers for current information
- Search for multiple perspectives on controversial topics

### 3. Source Diversification
- Official documentation and websites
- Technical blogs and industry publications
- Academic papers and research studies
- Community forums and discussions
- News articles and announcements

## Output Format

Your research should be structured as follows:

```
## Research Overview
- **Topic**: What was researched
- **Search Strategy**: Approach taken and key search terms used
- **Sources Found**: Number and types of sources consulted
