# RPI Loop CLI Tool - Implementation TODO List
*Atomic tasks organized by implementation phases*

## Implementation Strategy

Each task is **atomic** - completable by a single command (CLI command, file creation, file edit, tool use, etc.). Tasks are organized into phases with context budget management to stay under 40% utilization.

**Context Budget Target**: < 40% throughout implementation  
**Task Completion Criteria**: Each task must be fully complete before moving to next  
**Phase Transition**: Fresh context between phases for optimal results
