In the video "Advanced Context Engineering" by Dex from Human Layer, he discusses his experiences and insights on using AI coding agents. He begins by referencing two talks: one by Sean Grove called "The New Code" and a Stanford study. He explains that traditional "vibe coding" with AI agents can be counterproductive, leading to developers generating and then discarding prompts and code [[01:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=63)]. The Stanford study confirmed that AI engineering could slow down development, especially with complex or legacy codebases [[01:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=95)].

Dex shares a personal story about working with an AI coder that produced large pull requests of Go code that were difficult to review, leading him to adopt "spec-first development," where he reviewed the plan and not every line of code [[02:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=166)]. He then outlines three methods for improving context engineering:
* **Naive Method:** Interacting back and forth with the agent until you lose context or give up. An improved version of this is to start over with a fresh context when the agent gets off track [[04:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=244)].
* **Intentional Compaction:** Deliberately committing relevant files and information to the agent's memory to avoid flooding the context window with unnecessary data [[04:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=289)].
* **Frequent Intentional Compaction:** Building the entire workflow around context management to keep context utilization under 40% [[08:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=534)].

He breaks down the "Frequent Intentional Compaction" workflow into three phases: research, planning, and implementation. The research phase involves understanding the system, the plan phase explicitly outlines changes, and the implementation phase involves writing the code based on the plan [[09:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=549)].

Dex emphasizes the importance of human review during the research and planning stages, as these files are easier to read than thousands of lines of code [[10:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=608)]. He shares how this method was used to fix a bug in a large Rust codebase and add WASM support to a programming language [[11:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=673)]. He concludes by stressing that a bad plan can lead to thousands of lines of bad code and that the key is to ensure the agent understands the problem before it starts coding [[12:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc&t=723)].
