- **Tool Quality**: Exceptional user experience with minimal friction
- **Learning Support**: Appropriate guidance and documentation for skill level

## Universal Critical Success Factors

### 1. Exceptional Tool Quality
**Requirement**: Setup < 2 minutes, commands respond < 500ms, templates render flawlessly  
**Rationale**: Any friction in tool experience kills adoption before value can be demonstrated  
**Risk**: Poor tool quality creates lasting negative associations with methodology

### 2. Context-Appropriate Introduction
**Requirement**: Match RPI introduction to appropriate problem complexity for each engineer level  
**Rationale**: Wrong problem size creates either overwhelming complexity or underwhelming value  
**Risk**: Using RPI for simple tasks creates "overkill" perception that undermines credibility

### 3. Cultural Integration Strategy
**Requirement**: Position RPI as enhancing existing engineering values, not replacing them  
**Rationale**: Engineers resist methodologies that threaten autonomy or appear bureaucratic  
**Risk**: Cultural misalignment can kill adoption regardless of technical merit

### 4. Measurement and Evidence
**Requirement**: Clear, quantifiable evidence of RPI value at individual and organizational levels  
**Rationale**: Engineers and organizations need proof, not promises, especially for methodology changes  
**Risk**: Without evidence, RPI remains perpetual "pilot" without real adoption

### 5. Change Management Sophistication
**Requirement**: Professional-grade change management with level-appropriate strategies  
**Rationale**: Methodology adoption is organizational change, not tool deployment  
**Risk**: Treating RPI as simple tool adoption rather than cultural evolution
